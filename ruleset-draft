This is a definition of the ruleset that will be implemented in supernamer. Subject to change.

--custom=PYTHONCODE                     WIP. Accepts a string of python code to run as a ruleset. Still working on what limitations there will be
--discard=INTEGER                       Discards X characters from either the beginning or end of the filename. Negative numbers indicate discarding X characters from the end of the filename. First character is index 0. (Equivalent of "[:INTEGER]" in python)
--keep=INTEGER                          Keeps X characters from either the beginning or end of the filename. Negative numbers indicate keeping X characters starting at the end of the filename. First character is index 0. (Equivalent of "[INTEGER:]" in python)
--replace=STRING1,STRING2               Replaces instances of first string with second string in a filename
--slice=START,END                       Slices between two integers, representing start and stop values for a python slice. First character is index 0.

Definitiions:

INTEGER                                 An integer
STRING                                  A normal string, but can contain special rules as listed below

Special Rules
##                                      Indicates a single digit number (0-9). Can be used in sequence, e.g. #### can represent numbers from 00 - 99. This rule will copy those digits over to the renamed file
